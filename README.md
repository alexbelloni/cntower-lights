# CNTower Lights

CNTower Lights is a React app that displays the colors of the CN Tower on specific nights. This is not an official CN Tower website but rather a tribute to this iconic building in Toronto, Canada. Due to my persistent emails and tweets highlighting the app's calendar feature, which shows the tower's colors, the official lighting schedule website was eventually updated to include color representations instead of just text. However, because of web scraping issues with the CN Tower's website, the app's current month has been fixed to April since May 26, 2022.

I created an API that shares CNTower's schedule with dates, reasons, and colours.
